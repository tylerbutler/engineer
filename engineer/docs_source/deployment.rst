Deploying Engineer Sites
========================


One of the benefits to Engineer is that the resulting site can be uploaded to pretty much any web host. You can use
FTP to upload the site content anywhere, or use rsync to sync your local site to a remote server.

You can also deploy to Azure and GitHub Pages. Documentation for these options is not yet complete. However,
see `<http://www.tylerbutler.com/tag/engineer/>`_ for some information about doing this in the meantime.
